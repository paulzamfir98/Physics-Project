# Physics-Project
University project built with JavaFX.

## Description
This application verifies the occurance of condensantion in a building's envelope.
After the user inputs information about the environment and the wall, the program computes the pressure and saturation pressure for each layer of the wall and checks if that is a proper environment for the envelope, using a diagram.

## Features
  - GUI for input including alerts for bad or incomplete data; 
  - Pop-up dialog for saving an image of the chart; (name, extension and path have to be provided)

## Requirements

  - IntelliJ
  - JavaFX
  - JDK 8
